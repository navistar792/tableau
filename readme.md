# Tableau Assignment

### To make the assignment more interesting, I added New York covid data, to try to see if there was an impact on rentals. 

### The Data Wrangling Jupyter file was interesting. I wrote a script to combine all the files, which worked really well. However, its still a good practice to examine the data:
* the data format changed during the period of analysis, so I wrote a script to rename and combine the data. That was good practice!
* It's also good to review the data, since one of the months had duplicates - i wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't thoroughly reviewed the data. 
* The covid data was easy to format, but it took some time to find the right data for only New York City

The assigment was bittersweet, since my company stopped using Tableau to save money, and i forgot how much better it was than Power BI (IMHO)

Shawns feedback about formatting the data before adding it to tableau was quite useful for the assignment and at work. I  have already started using Python to clean data before publishing with Power bI, and I think that saves me a lot of time and saves angst trying to get Power BI to do things it isn't very good at

I didn't upload the data files - some were too large and github wouldn't let me upload them :()
